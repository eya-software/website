      <h1>Equity for Education</h1>
      <p>In light of the recent push for equality across the country, weâ€™ve decided to focus on one of the biggest drivers of inequality, education disparities, for our next initiative. The goal of the initiative is to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Expose the structures and institutions that perpetuate inequality in education</li>
        <li>Tell the stories of people affected by education inequality to humanize the issue</li>
        <li>Advocate for reform so that we can bring an end to education inequality!</li>
      </ol>
